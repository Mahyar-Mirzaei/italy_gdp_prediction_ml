## Predicting Italy’s GDP Growth Using Machine Learning

This project applies multiple linear regression to forecast Italy’s annual GDP growth rate based on macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, unemployment, government spending, and exports.
The model achieved an R² score of 0.89, indicating a strong explanatory power for the relationship between the selected factors and GDP growth.

## Overview

This study explores the use of statistical and machine learning techniques to understand and predict Italy’s economic growth.
By applying regression modeling to macroeconomic data, the project demonstrates how data-driven methods can enhance economic forecasting and policy analysis.

Objective: Estimate Italy’s GDP growth using macroeconomic features

Model: Multiple Linear Regression

Performance Metric: R² = 0.89

Programming Language: Python

Key Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data

The dataset consists of annual macroeconomic indicators from World Bank.

All variables were standardized prior to model training to ensure comparability across features.

## Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalization

Exploratory Analysis: Correlation matrix and multicollinearity assessment

Model Training: Implementation of multiple linear regression

Evaluation: Performance measured using R² and residual diagnostics

Visualization: Economic trend plots and model performance charts

## Results

R² Score: 0.89

The model captures key macroeconomic relationships influencing Italy’s GDP growth.
